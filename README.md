# TernVsIfElse
This is a project to determine if the terniary operator saves a significant amount of real time off of a program's runtime.
The reason this test is on github instead of replit is due to the limitations of using small data sets on replit. I'd like to be able to run a test on 1+ billion inputs to see if there's a change in results.
